Dream Wedding
DEVELOPMENT OF AN E-COMMERCE OR BUSINESS-TYPE WEBSITE.

1.	Techniques
To complete the project, I used techniques such as:
−	Use clear and descriptive headings: “Dream Wedding.”
My goals and target audience, which are couples who are getting married and want to hold a very formal wedding but also need to stay up to date with the latest trends, are laid out in very specific headings and content. Whether it's guidance or the wedding they've been longing for, they now want it to happen.
−	Use descriptive link text rather than general expressions like "click here" or "read more." Screen readers can better understand where the link leads thanks to this. 
I have a lot of detailed pictures, articles, wedding attire, and decorations for my clients to read and select what suits them the best.
−	Use captions and transcripts for multimedia content: My customers will find it simpler to understand and follow the meaning of each product now that I have added detailed transcripts for each picture and video I provided.
−	Test website with accessibility tools: The website was reviewed with current browsers before going live in order to accurately identify and fix any errors.
−	Ensure proper HTML structure: To make my website more accessible to assistive technologies and search engines, use proper HTML structure and semantic markup.
−	Design with user needs in mind: We can fulfill every customer's wish for a wedding ceremony, and this website was made specifically for that purpose.
−	Using searching tool such as: search bar or sort, filter for each page
2. Search Engine
•	Relevant keywords related to customers have been included in the content and meta tags to improve the website's ranking in search results.
•	The website's structure is clear and easy to navigate, which can help search engines index the site more effectively.
•	The website's load time has been optimized by compressing images and using efficient coding practices to improve page speed.

STEPS	
ISSUES
1. Plan and design ideas	
•	Bringing up the website’s subject	
•	Decide the color for website	
•	Find template for the design	
•	Find image of products	
2. Create folder and file for website	
3. Code and design with Home page	
•	Write code on html	
•	Write code for nav bar	
•	Link code between each page	
•	Add script for swipe button	- The part of the swipe button that I got the idea for on the page was quite difficult because my original plan was to include a photo section with a "Learn more" card button to make it easier for customers to learn and refer to the newest wedding trends. However, it was this desire that compelled me to learn more about writing JavaScript for browsing and to modify the code to suit the purpose of my website.
•	Write code for footer	
•	Write code in css for Home page	 - As I was writing the style for the header, I ran into issues with the text overlay on the image. The "outro" balance adjustment is particularly challenging, so I had to adjust and search Google to figure out how to make the overlay fit.
•	Add image	
4. Write code in generalStyles.css for footer and nav bar.	- I had to edit and find a font to match the original concept because the idea with the logo is to manually write the style rather than insert the logo image. As a result, I learned a lot more ways to edit style on CSS.
5. Code and design with Contact page	
•	Write contact form	- The page online served as the inspiration for the contact form, and since Bootstraps were not allowed, I struggled to fix the style so that it was nearly identical to the original concept. This was because I had to scale the form's accompanying image. The way to change each time I click on the label, however, also forces me to learn a lot to fit the best.
•	Add script for “Submit” button	- The section of JavaScript with the "submit" button I struggle with the fact that when the customer presses the button, the message box "Submit successful" will appear; as a result, I switch to only showing the line but below the form. However, to calculate the application and make it more powerful, I have added each fill-in field to the form so that it will display an alert "missing field" when the customer does not enter all the necessary information.
•	Write code in css for Contact page	
•	Add images	
6. Code and design with Dresses page	
•	Write code for list products	- It's difficult for me to get the added product to display as 1 row with the appropriate number of columns for each row and to automatically reroll after 1 row is full.
•	Add script for showing products 	- When I opened the first product, then closed the page and clicked on another one, it continued to add to the previously opened one and I did, which is how I got the error when I wanted to create a page to show photos and product descriptions to customers. fix that error as well as the one that occurs when an image is enlarged on a new page.
•	Add images	- The file was overwritten as a result of adding too many images, so I had to switch to copying the url link rather than saving it to my computer and adding the image as before.
7. Code and design with About Us page	- I made the decision to keep the Bootstraps portion of this page even though I knew I couldn't use them because I didn't have time to fix the code and I was happy with the overall design of the page.
4. Reflection 
The entire web development process necessitates thorough learning from the previous process while also looking for new ways to enhance your own project. I gained a lot of knowledge and experience after finishing the project on my own, including how to write code for web design and how to make websites that will draw in customers.
I gained a deeper understanding of HTML coding, how to create a product list, how to write an outro for the web, how to create a form, how to create a dropdown for the nav bar, how to do swipe cards, how to link pages together, and more through the process of creating the project, more specifically, the use of JavaScript, which I've started to get the hang of. In addition, the challenge of styling in CSS has helped me to better understand Web layout and design. For me, the CSS is this time's web development project's most challenging and time-consuming component. 
To avoid having to keep changing the design, if I get the chance to work on a project that is like this one or do a project on web development, I will have a more defined idea before I start writing code. The length of the design process will have a big impact on how quickly the work is completed. It will also be necessary to know in advance which web features will be accessible to facilitate and speed up coding.
